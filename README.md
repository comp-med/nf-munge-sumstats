# Nextflow Template

This repository can be used as a basis for analysis workflows built with the
[Nextflow DSL](https://www.nextflow.io/). The files and directory structure was
derived from
[template-nf](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/template-nf-guide/).
More information about the structure of a workflow can be found
[here](https://training.nextflow.io/advanced/structure/).
